# Script-Testing-Website
This is a partially empty, basic website that can be used to try code and output as much results as it possibly can for the developer to test.

It is best to clone / fork this using GIT for Windows / MAC directly into your local servers directory. You can then make changes in a branch, apply them and have it sync to the server.
